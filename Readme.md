# Welcome to my project (Reciprocal best hits calculator)
Author: Melika Ahmadian


## Dependencies
- Ensure you have BLAST+ installed on your system and accesible from command-line.

## How to run
- In the directory of the project, run ``` python/python3 main.py```
- Make sure you add two files with the same name since I hard coded the names :(
- The script should automaticly run and generate reciprocal_best_hits.txt.
- I have already left the one I generated but you can delete and generate your own version.
